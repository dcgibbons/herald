README for the Herald Project
=============================


What is it?
-----------

Herald is a instant messenging client that uses the MSN Messenger
network. Herald is written using 100% Java code, so it should be portable
across all operating environments that have a Java 2 run-time environment.


Why, oh why??
-------------

Why on Earth do we need another instant messaging client, especially one
that uses the resources of that "evil" company, Microsoft? The answer
is easy and boring. One of locations several of us worked for would not
allow the other common instant messaging clients (i.e. ICQ or AOL) through
their firewall. Messenger worked perfectly. In addition, the Messenger
protocol keeps all contact list information on the server, which is a
very handy feature missing from the other instant messaging systems.

Unfortunately, Microsoft's client for their own system has several
undesirable limitations. The most obvious is that it only runs in the
Windows platform. Additionally, several useful instant messaging features,
such as file transfer, are missing from the client. And finally, there
is a huge need for encrypted messages in the instant messaging world. Why
not give the network a boost by adding such a compelling feature?

LATEST UPDATE
=============

As of 2012-10-11, I put a copy of this source on GitHub instead of its
original SourceForge CVS home. The project is still inactive, but having
the source available in GitHub may prove useful for someone some day, and
also reminds me what projects I worked on in the past.

In retrospect, I'm not sure I understood Java very well back in 2000.
