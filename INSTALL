INSTALL for the Herald Project


What tools do I need?
---------------------

To build Herald, you'll need any Java 2 SDK installed. 

To use the cryptography features of Herald you will need to have a
Java Cryptography provider install. The Sun provided extension at
<http://java.sun.com/products/jce/index.html> is the best place to start.


How is it built?
----------------

To build Herald, simply use one of the two scripts in the root
directory. For UNIX platforms, build.sh should fit the bill. Windows
platforms should use build.bat. For other platforms it should be straight
forward to execute the appropriate commands listed in either of the
scripts named above.

Since building all the source in a Java application is usually much
cheaper than figuring out exactly what to build, the build scripts employ
this strategy.

Building herald creates a herald.jar file that can be executed using
the Java run-time, i.e.

        java -jar herald.jar



Thanks for trying Herald!
